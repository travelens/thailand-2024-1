Advertised as "A stylish and clean 3-story townhouse in Chiang Mai's prime location, boasting large, comfy space, safety, and serenity." on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/30682712?adults=6&children=0&infants=0&pets=0&wishlist_item_id=11003294352864&check_in=2024-11-12&check_out=2024-11-19&source_impression_id=p3_1710381379_5wsYKbGhkcDFOigg&previous_page_section_name=1000&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1-ncCIEvNNyLUBcf5w1pawIurxP_6nUrrzIS7tlB_Uz1Lrw90PLQ7skAg_aem_nyXaalX7r9QVk-hcl7s4Iw), this was our "home" whilst we were in Chiang Mai.

I liked it a lot, it was about 10 min walk to MAYA and Nimman and quite convenient.
