We used the same songthaew driver to take us from Charoen Prathet Rd to [Central Festival Chiang Mai
เซ็นทรัลเชียงใหม่](https://www.central.co.th/en/store/central-festival-chiangmai). Actually, he was willing to wait for us for 100 baht so it was a bonus. He was amused once again that we werent aware when we arrived at the destination, and gave us the shrug again. He then gave another gesture after we aligted to let us know we were walking in the wrong direction!

Central Festival Chiangmai is the largest, most comprehensive, and most modern shopping complex in Northern Thailand, covering an area of 70 rai. It is located on the Superhighway and Chiangmai-Doi Saket Road.

We are hungry by now, so we stopped by at the food hall to search for lunch.

I posed an Under Armour store as one of the classes I teach at university is doing a case study assessment on it.

I bought thie very pretty dress by Lolita in Central. I can't belie ve it costs 590 baht (around A$25).

After Central Festival, we headed to Warorot Market via songthaew to find some traditional Thai costumes to wear for the Loy Krathong Festival. Warorot Market (Thai: ตลาดวโรรส), locally known as Kad Luang (กาดหลวง; lit: "Big Market") is a market and one of tourist attractions in Chiang Mai Province, regarded as the largest and most well-known market in the north region of Thailand.

Here, everyone managed to find something to buy, and we also had some delicious soda drinks. By 4pm hwoever, we were pretty exhausted and caught our final songthaew for the day to head back to the AirBNB house. The route back seemed to take forever and I can only assume it was peak hour on the main roads. The cost was still the same though (30 baht per person).

This video gives a glimpse of how to make a Thai dessert:
