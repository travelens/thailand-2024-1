Wat Tung Yu (วัดทุงยู) is a hidden gem located right in the middle of the Chiang Mai old city and looks beautiful at night. The primary assembly hall of the temple is tiny and compact, although it features a beautiful three-tiered roof with elaborately decorated gables that extend from the temple’s main structure. The main entrance to Wat Thung Yu is the smaller viharn, whose entrance is guarded by two intricately carved naga serpents. There are also two statues of two monks; on the left is a golden monk statue of Kruba Srivichai, who was one of the Lanna Kingdom’s most revered monks. Srivichai was responsible for overseeing the construction of many of Chiang Mai’s temples. Between these statues is a Buddha footprint, which is covered using a Burmese umbrella known as a Pathein Htee. Inside the temple I found many intricate murals depicting various stories from the Buddha's life. Behind the viharn is a small chedi.
