We arrived in Chiang Mai in the afternoon, which gave us some time to rest before heading out again to experience the Loy Krathong (ลอยกระทง) Festival in Chiang Mai.

The giant street parade takes place in the evening and features a vibrant procession of illuminated floats, performers, musicians, and dancers moving through the streets of Chiang Mai. We watched the parade around Pratu Tha Phae Park, Tambon Si Phum, Amphoe Mueang near the Tha Phae Gate.

We saw traditional performances, cultural displays, and various forms of artistic expression in the parade. Afterwards, we sampled some street food. I was surprised the street vendors hurriedly packed up and left after we ordered, and then I realised the street was being reopened after the parade had passed and they were all blocking the road.

Because the street was so crowded, we had our driver order two tuk tuks to carry us home, but we had to wait a while for them to arrive because of traffic. However, we managed to enjoy some fireworks whilst waiting for the tuk tuks.
