One of Cat's high school friend has retired in Chiang Mai and decided to take us our for dinner. He and his wife and her friends met us at the AirBNB house and offered us a platter of Thai desserts:

We went to [Chef's Together by Aod & Dan](https://www.facebook.com/chefstogehter/) via two cars. It is located at Charoen Prathet Rd beside the Ping River (actually I saw it this morning whilst walking along this road).

It is a trendy place with an international menu but we ordered some northern Thai dishes which were amazing. Unfortunately I have forgotten the names of the dishes, but I loved the coconutless curry and the deep fried prawn heads.

Because it is the Loy Krathong festival, there were fireworks by the river, and also several musical performances, by bands playing a selection of songs including old favourites.

After dinner, we walked along the Ping riverbank, and crossed the Iron Bridge. We saw some festivalgoers lighting water lanterns and launching them by the riverside.

On the way back, we drove past Tha Pae St which were lit up using many light arches for the festival.
