The [Sunday Market](https://www.visitchiangmai.com.au/sunday_market.html) (or Walking Street) is a large market located right in the centre of the old walled city area of Chiang Mai. Starting at the Tha Phae Gate at one end the Sunday Market extends for roughly 1km down the full length of Ratchadamnoen Road. We caught a tuk tuk from the house where we are staying which dropped us outside Wat Phra Singh end and we walked down Ratchadamnoen St. There were a lot of stalls and street food on display, but I found it overwhelming. There is a huge number of assorted stalls and vendors selling a wide array of goods including shoes, bags, jewellery, paintings, crafts, scarves, clothing, accessories, and more!
