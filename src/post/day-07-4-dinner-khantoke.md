A khantoke or khantok (ขันโตก) is a pedestal tray used as a small dining table by the Lanna people (of northern Thailand), Laotians, and by people from Isan (northeastern Thailand). The tradition of hosting traditional khanthoke dinners was initiated by Kraisi Nimmanhemin in 1906, a well–known business man and Lanna Thai scholar. The diners often enjoy the experience of sitting cross-legged on the floor ,sampling Northern cuisine from a shared khantoke tray and enhanced
with Northern classical dances.

We arrived at the venue dressed in traditional Thai outfits and it took a while for our khantoke to arrive as the venue seems to be prioritising large tour groups. However, the food was good and it was bottomless as well which helped.

There were various shows including a tee dance and various hill tribe dances.

This is the video of the parade and Tee dance:
