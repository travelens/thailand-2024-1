After breakfast we headed to [Lalitta Cafe](https://www.lalittacafe.com) - [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/LalittaTH). We were originally supposed to have breakfast here, but unfortunately our driver discovered they don't open until 10am.

This cafe feels like it is straight out of a fairy tale, or at least a theme park set in a fairy tale. It features lush greenery, lots of mist and streams, and a "mountain" cliff face complete with status of fairies and waterfalls.

This is a map of the cafe (from the website):

We spent a happy time wandering around the forest paths - the clever design of intricate curvy paths covered with mist made the place a lot bigger than it actually was. Margaret and I had coffee and cake here whilst the other ladies had foot massages.
