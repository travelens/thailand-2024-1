After Mae Kampong, we headed to the Mae On District to attend the 2024 [Chiang Mai CAD Khom Loy Sky Lantern Festival](https://yipengchiangmailanternfestival.com). The venue is located at 9 Ban Sa Ha Khon, On Klang, Mae On District, Chiang Mai 50130. [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/cmCADFestival).

Celebrating the combined Yi Peng and Loy Krathong festivals in Chiang Mai. Yi Peng is celebrated by floating lanterns into the sky and Loy Krathong is celebrated by floating lanterns on a river.

Yi Peng refers to the full moon day in the second month according to the Lanna lunar calendar (the twelfth month of the Thai lunar calendar). The festival is meant as a time to make merit literally: ‘floating lanterns’, are launched into the air. Khomloy are made from a thin fabric, such as rice paper, stretched over a bamboo or wire frame, to which a candle or fuel cell is attached. When the fuel cell is lit, the resulting hot air is trapped inside the lantern and creates enough lift for the Khomloy to float into the sky. During festival, some people also decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with Khom Fai intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. Khom Thue are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, Khom Khwaen are the hanging lanterns, which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside.

“Loy Krathong” are celebrated jointly with Yi Peng in Chiang Mai. In town we can see lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls. Loy (ลอย) means “to float”, while Krathong (กระทง) has various meanings, one of which is “A small container made of leaves which float on water during the Loy Krathong festival”. Krathong is traditionally a small leaf container which is made to hold a small portion of goods like a traditional Thai dish (such as “Hor Mok”) or dessert. The traditional Krathong used for floating at the festival are made from a slice of a banana tree trunk or a spider lily plant. A bread Krathong will disintegrate after a few days. Banana stalk Krathong are also biodegradable, but they pollute the rivers and may take years to decompose.

A Kratong is decorated with elaborately-folded banana leaves, incense sticks, and a candle. A small coin is sometimes included as an offering to the river spirits. On the night of the full moon, Thais launch their kratong on a river, canal or a pond, making a wish as they do so. The festival may originate from an ancient ritual paying respect to the water spirits. Thai Buddhists in Thailand to honor the Buddha, The candle venerates the Buddha with light, while the Krathong’s floating symbolizes letting go of all one’s hatred, anger, and defilements. People sometimes cut their fingernails or hair and place the clippings on the Krathong as a symbol of letting go of past transgressions and negative thoughts. Many Thais use the Krathong to thank the Goddess of Water.

I found the Yi Peng festival celebratory and magical, and the Loy Krathong contemplative and reflective. Due to the risk of fire, the former is now banned in the city of Chiang Mai but still allowed on the outskirts. Traditionally, both are celebrated by families and communities. Being tourists, we bought Premium tickets (6400 baht per person) to the "official" Chiangmai CAD Khomloy Sky Lantern Festival which combined both festivals along with dinner and a concert/performance. I must admit, I was surprised by how expensive the tickets are - they cost all the way up to nearly A$1000 (for "Elite" tickets - 15,500 baht). But when I saw the level of organisation involved, particularly to manage the risk of fire and providing food and entertainment to thousands of people, I understood. It's a very touristy event - with lots of Japanese, Brazilian, Chinese and other nationalities attending. I am guessing the average Thai won't be able to afford the ticket prices. I have read some criticism of the event - that it represents a fire and environmental risk, with the lanterns blocking air traffic, harming wildlife and polluting the countryside, but I would also like to think about the economic benefits to the region, and at the end of the day it was a truly magical and uplifting moment.

This is my video of the event - it was an amazing experience and one I will remember forever. I think we lit up enough lanterns to light up a street! Shot in widescreen for that dramatic cinematic look - but there is no screen wide enough to capture the sky that night!
