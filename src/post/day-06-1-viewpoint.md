We stopped about halfway up the Srivichai Alley, which is the road from Chiang Mai up Doi Suthep, at Chaloem Phra Kiat Pavilion Viewpoint
(จุดชมวิวศาลาเฉลิมพระเกียรติ). There are a number of stalls here selling souvenirs and food, as well as a pavilion for viewing a panoramic view of Chiang Mai. I discovered a lot of stray dogs sleeping on the roadside. I also met two cyclists who we had observed climbing up the road from the van. They told me this is about halfway up on the way to Doi Suthep and it is a popular route for cyclists. They said the gradient of the road was not too steep, averaging about 6% but there are some steep sections just before reaching the temple.

This is the view of Chiang Mai from the pavilion:

And this is the video of the cyclist tacking the beginning of the second half of the climb:
