In the morning, we visited the Thai Silk Village (บริษัท ไทยซิลค์วิลเลจ จำกัด), 120/27 หมู่3 ถนนเชียงใหม่-สันกำแพง สันกลาง อำเภอสันกำแพง เชียงใหม่ 50130 ([Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thaisilkvillage)) where there is a demonstration of how silkworms are grown, harvested, and boiled to make exquisite silk which is woven into delicate and colourful fabrics.

We stopped by at the entrance to take some photos before venturing inside. I was quite interested in the silkworm exhibit and factory as I have never seen silk being made before. The adjoining shop contained many lovely fabrics and ready made clothes. However, I did not buy anything, even though the prices in the clearance section were actually quite reasonable.
