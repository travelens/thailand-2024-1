Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, a group of us have been dreaming that we will take an overseas trip together once international travel restrictions have been lifted and we enter the brave new world of post-COVID vacations. Our dream is finally realised in 2024 when we are able to plan a trip to Bangkok. We literally spent many days talking about where we would go and what activities we would participate in.

We quickly agreed some ground rules - we would focus on food, sightseeing and shopping (not necessarily in that order, but that would be my personal priorities). The opportunity came when we realised plane tickets to Bangkok were quite reasonable (not quite pre-COVID sale prices but okay) and we all quickly booked our flights. We then scoured around for properties to rent so that we can stay together as a group.

We decided initially to just visit Chiang Mai and Bangkok, but then we realised there were a lot of things to see in Chiang Rai and it would be rushed to do it as a day trip. We hired a private tour driver who planned an itinerary for us. Cat, who is half-Thai, took charge of planning our itinerary in Bangkok.

I tried my best to lose weight before the trip, but unfortunately I completely failed in this endeavour so I boarded the plane feeling heavy.

This trip is so massive for the sake of optimising storage I have broken the trip to two parts. In Part 1, we fly from Sydney and arrive in Chiang Mai via Bangkok. We spent about a week in both Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, visiting a variety of locations and sampling food from many places.

In [Part 2](/thailand-2024-2/) the adventure continues in Bangkok as we fly from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and spent a week there including a side trip to Amphawa.
